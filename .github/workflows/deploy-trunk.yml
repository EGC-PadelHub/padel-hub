# ============================================================================
# WORKFLOW: Deploy to Preproduction (Trunk Branch)
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Automatic deployment to preproduction when changes are pushed to trunk
# 
# Triggers:
#   - Push to trunk branch (merges from feature/* or bugfix branches)
#
# Process:
#   1. Trigger Render deployment webhook for preproduction environment
#   2. Verify deployment was triggered successfully (HTTP 200/202)
#
# Notes:
#   - Feature branches merge directly to trunk for testing
#   - No tests run here (tests run on main before production deploy)
#   - Preproduction environment for validation before merging to main
